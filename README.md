# vim-commentr

The commenter plugin for Vim.

## Features

- Block or inline? Commentr automagically picks the best one for you.
- Commentr can comment every single $h!t character for you. No restrictions. Comment with the full power of motions.
- Commentr is also file-type aware and properly escapes comments, so you never again have to fear of editing HTML or Vue files.
- Insert documentation, module or any other kind of comments into Rust or anywhere you want. Add your bindings for your favourite groups and configuration.
- Everything configurable with a single line.
- Does not use `setline()`.
- Lightweight.
- Impossible? Install and try out.
